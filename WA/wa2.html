        <h2>Some More About Me</h2>
        <p>A junior CTD major with a minor in fine arts! I love the three C's coffee, community, and anything creative.</p>
        <h3>Why Web?</h3>
        <p>I own my LLC and work in the design and art spaces which means I really need a portfolio that represents me.</p>
