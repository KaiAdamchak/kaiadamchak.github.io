                <p>
                    Today is the last day of my design finals (just random tests left). My friend Sam and I are presenting our lamps that we've spent the last week making. They're a series of three lamps all made from different materials but with one cohesive theme. One is a laser cut sconce based off a turkey tail mushroom. The second is a 3D printed lamp that is meant to look like dripping water. It's based off the artist kumbhglass. And final, Sam made a lamp shade of burned book pages. They turned out really great and I'm definetly going to add them to my portfolio soon.

                    Finals is kicking my butt because I have to create a 3 lamps, program a website, and paint the biggest painting I've ever done. It's been rough but I'm also happy with the products that I'm making and I think I can add them to my portfolio. On a happier note because it doesn't involve finals, I have my third show in a public place coming up in January. It's going to be at Lafayette Public Library and it will be paintings as well as physical and digital prints. More information to come.

                    I am currently working on programming this website so that I can have my own personally programmed portfolio. It's going shockingly well and I'm really excited about it. I started by sketching out some ideas about looking through Pinterest and now here we are.
