                <h3>Decemeber 28th 2023</h3>
                <p>
                    I have finished three prints of ducks in a pond that I named quack 1,2, and 3. They didn't go quite as planned but I like how they turned out. The idea was that I would paint the paper with jelly gouache, blue, to make the pond. Then I used my iPad with Procreate to draw out the outline of about six different ducks. Using parchment paper as a stand-in for transfer paper, I then transfer those drawings to a linoleum block to cut the ducks out and make individual stamps. Once those were done I tried using a white ink pad to stamp them on the paper but I neglected to think about the fact that the paper I was using was textured so it didn’t stamp well even after I used my linocut tools. So that's when we had to get creative, cause if we’re being honest art never really goes as planned. To fix the piece I continued to use the stamps to get the shape and placement of the ducks, but once that was done I went over them with white acrylic paint to make them more opaque. That’s what you can see in the picture below (which I took with my new tripod that I invested in.) From there I used acrylic marker for the bills and legs, colored pencil for the water ripples, and what I have discovered to be my favorite ink pen for the outline of each duck. Finally, I numbered, signed, and labeled each print so that they are ready to go. I’m still deciding whether to frame them for my show so I’m going to go to Walmart to see what they have since I’m on a budget.

                    I made a couple posters to advertise my upcoming art show. The first two are my favorite and the third was just kinda an iteration when I was working on it. I'm not advertising a lot because I've been so busy but we'll see, I have a lot to do.

                    Today is the last day of my design finals (just random tests left). My friend Sam and I are presenting our lamps that we've spent the last week making. They're a series of three lamps all made from different materials but with one cohesive theme. One is a laser cut sconce based off a turkey tail mushroom. The second is a 3D printed lamp that is meant to look like dripping water. It's based off the artist kumbhglass. And final, Sam made a lamp shade of burned book pages. They turned out really great and I'm definetly going to add them to my portfolio soon.

                    Finals is kicking my butt because I have to create a 3 lamps, program a website, and paint the biggest painting I've ever done. It's been rough but I'm also happy with the products that I'm making and I think I can add them to my portfolio. On a happier note because it doesn't involve finals, I have my third show in a public place coming up in January. It's going to be at Lafayette Public Library and it will be paintings as well as physical and digital prints. More information to come.

                    I am currently working on programming this website so that I can have my own personally programmed portfolio. It's going shockingly well and I'm really excited about it. I started by sketching out some ideas about looking through Pinterest and now here we are.
