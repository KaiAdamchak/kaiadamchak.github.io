                <p>
                Kai Lienâ€™s current show consists of a multimedia gallery including paintings, prints, and drawings, created over the past 5 years. With pieces selected from past themed shows and projects, the current collection will be a representation of the growth of a young artist from Lafayette as she goes from highschool art classes to being a college undergrad with an art minor and her own design brand.
