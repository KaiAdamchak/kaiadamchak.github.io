                <h3>Final Product</h3>
                <p>
                    Using laser cut plywood this piece is a 3D recreation of a topographic map of the state that I've lived my whole life in.

                <list>
                    <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                    <p>Illustrator</p>
                    <p>Laser Cutter</p>
                    <h4>Materials</h4>
                    <p>Plywood Panel</p>
                    <h4>Problems</h4>
                    <p>When it came the design process this piece was a lot of fun and it gave me a chance to get some practice with the pen tool in Illustrator. </p>
                    <p>However, the material I was given for this project did not cut well as all with the laser cutter and as a result I had a lot of issues during the process of this piece. I completely destroyed my first piece of wood after trying to cut it amost 3 times. I then got another piece of wood and turned down the laser cutters speed so that it cut most of the way through eventually. Then the rectangles I used to stack the pieces had a lot of problems resulting in all the connections heavily relying on hot glue. Eventually I do like the end product of the piece the process was just a lot of problem solving rather than a plan that wokred out well.</p>
