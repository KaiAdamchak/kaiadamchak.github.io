                <p>
                    The final for my 3D modeling and prototyping class was two create three different lamps, each one madae from a different material but all unified by one general theme. A partner and I created three lamps based on the concept of earth, fire and water. I was in charge of two of the lamps and the rendering of the 3D models using blender. It was my first time using blender and I wish I had had more time to learn how to use the software, but it enouraged me to learn in my freetime in the future. More information in the final report linked.
